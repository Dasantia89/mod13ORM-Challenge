Associations
You'll need to execute association methods on your Sequelize models to create the following relationships between them:

Product belongs to Category, as a category can have multiple products but a product can only belong to one category.

Category has many Product models.

Product belongs to many Tag models. Using the ProductTag through model, allow products to have multiple tags and tags to have many products.

Tag belongs to many Product models.

HINT
Make sure you set up foreign key relationships that match the column we created in the respective models.

Fill Out the API Routes to Perform RESTful CRUD Operations
Fill out the unfinished routes in product-routes.js, tag-routes.js, and category-routes.js to perform create, read, update, and delete operations using your Sequelize models.

HINT
Be sure to look at your module project's code for syntax help and use your model's column definitions to figure out what req.body will be for POST and PUT routes!

Seed the Database
After creating the models and routes, run npm run seed to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes.

Sync Sequelize to the Database on Server Start
Create the code needed in server.js to sync the Sequelize models to the MySQL database on server start.
